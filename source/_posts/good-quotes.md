Every now and then, I stumble across a quote which changes my life a little bit. I’ve always wanted to have a safe, organized place to keep these little gems. So here it is – my drawer of good quotes!

If you want to understand something, write about it.  
If you want to master something, teach it.
{% endblockquote %}
