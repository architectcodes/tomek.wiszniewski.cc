Every now and then I stumble across an inspiring quote somewhere. I’ve always wanted to have a safe, organized place to keep these. So here it is – my drawer of good quotes.

{% blockquote Yogi Bhajan %}
If you want to learn something, read about it.  
If you want to understand something, write about it.  
If you want to master something, teach it.
{% endblockquote %}
