Every now and then, I stumble across a quote which changes my life a little bit. I’ve always wanted to have a safe, organized place to keep these little gems. So here it is – my drawer of good quotes! <!-- more -->

{% blockquote Yogi Bhajan %}
If you want to learn something, read about it.  
If you want to understand something, write about it.  
If you want to master something, teach it.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Richard Feldman https://youtu.be/WqV5kqaFRDU Web Apps without Web Servers %}
We’d have to step into the realm of science fiction  
to come up with a delivery method  
that is better than what web apps have today.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Bill Scott https://vimeo.com/91537336 Bringing Change to Life %}
The outside-in culture: Get out of the building! • Custom metrics driving everything. • Fail fast, learn fast.  
Lots of experimentation.
{% endblockquote %}
