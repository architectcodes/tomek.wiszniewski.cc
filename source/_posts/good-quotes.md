Every now and then, I stumble across a quote which changes my life a little bit. I’ve always wanted to have a safe, organized place to keep these little gems. So here it is – my drawer of good quotes! <!-- more -->

{% blockquote Yogi Bhajan %}

If you want to understand something, write about it.  
If you want to master something, teach it.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Richard Feldman, Web Apps without Web Servers https://youtu.be/WqV5kqaFRDU %}
We’d have to step into the realm of science fiction  
to come up with a delivery method  
that is better than what web apps have today.
{% endblockquote %}
